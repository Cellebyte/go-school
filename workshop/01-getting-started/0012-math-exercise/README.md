## Exercise

Write a Go program that accepts the **radius** of a circle as input, and returns the **diameter**, **circumference**, and **area**.

This program will require use of `math.Pi` in conjunction with `math.Pow` and multiplication operations.

## Formulas
- `D = radius * 2`
- `C = 2*π*r`
- `A = π*r²`


## Hint

How to read the input? You can figure it out by looking at the `fmt` package documentation.
Otherwise, check the hint.md file for a hint.
